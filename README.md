# Ã˜MQ Nodeos Plugin

Lighter version of the [eosio zmq_plugin](https://github.com/cc32d9/eos_zmq_plugin)

## Configuration

The following configuration statements in `config.ini` are recognized:

* `plugin = eosio::zmq_plugin` -- enables the ZMQ plugin

* `zmq-action-blacklist = CODE::ACTION` -- filter out a specific action

Action `onblock` in `eosio` account is ignored and is not producing a
ZMQ event. These actions are generated every 0.5s, and ignored in order
to save the CPU resource.

* `zmq-sender-bind = ENDPOINT` -- specifies the PUSH socket binding
endpoint. Default value: `tcp://127.0.0.1:5556`.

#### Whitelist options

* `zmq-whitelist-account-file = FILENAME` -- whilelist accounts from a file (one account name per line)

* `zmq-whitelist-account = ACCOUNT` -- sets up a whitelist, so that only traces for specified accounts are exported. Multiple options define multiple accounts to trace. If the account is a contract, all its actions (including inline actions) are exported. Also all transfers to and from the account, system actions, and third-party notifications are triggering the trace export. Whitelisted accounts will override the blacklist.

* `zmq-use-bloom-filter` -- WARNING: experimental bloom filter, optimized for large lists.

#### Whitelist HTTP API

Example to set a new whitelist
`curl -sL -X POST -d '["eosio.token"]' http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/zmq/set_whitelist`

Get the current whitelist with
`curl -sL http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/zmq/get_whitelist`
